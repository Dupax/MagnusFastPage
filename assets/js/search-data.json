This code searches Bing for &quot;Hotdogs&quot; and &quot;Sandwich&quot;, &quot;Pizza&quot; and &quot;burger&quot; and places the images in their respective folders. The reasoning for searching to food instead of anything else was that other food would be the hardest for the AI to distinguish a hotdog from and thus anything else would be a cakewalk. . Initially we simply searched for &quot;food -hotdog&quot; but later Sandwich, Pizza and burger was added as we noticed the AI had a hard time distinguish these from hotdogs, so we wanted to give it more training on these in peticular. . learn = cnn_learner(dls, resnet18, metrics=error_rate) learn.fine_tune(4) . epoch train_loss valid_loss error_rate time . 0 | 2.336467 | 1.021466 | 0.342593 | 00:27 | . epoch train_loss valid_loss error_rate time . 0 | 0.766608 | 0.379545 | 0.157407 | 00:27 | . 1 | 0.551006 | 0.198412 | 0.074074 | 00:27 | . 2 | 0.423204 | 0.138817 | 0.046296 | 00:27 | . 3 | 0.365362 | 0.129856 | 0.046296 | 00:27 | . interp = ClassificationInterpretation.from_learner(learn) interp.plot_confusion_matrix() . As seen above a few tuning runs we amanaged to achive relavtively good acuracy. Of course there are still things to ironed out, for instance runnning a picture of the earth by the AI it will be around 90% sure that it is a picture of a pizza. . Art . it was brought to our attention that the Danish National Museum of art was in the possession the origin of except the title and year. They were asking for the public’s help in identifying the artist behind the piece. Thinking this was a perfect test for our AI skills. As such, we found all the artists we could who lived during the period the painting was painted and downloaded images of their work. Here we sadly ran into some issues, first it was hard to find good images of the paintings with sufficient detail, also the quantity of paintings from the individual artists was rather low, making for a bad dataset. The data we got needed heavy editing as a majority was their low quality or entirely irrelevant to the subject. It was also relevant to rethink how we where going to achieve a shared image size as stretching the images would reduce quality to the point where identifying a given artists particular style would be impossible. .",

With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. . A #hide_input comment at the top of any code cell will only hide the input of that cell. .

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | . And a numbered list: . item 1 | item 2 | Boxes and stuff . This is a quotation . . You can include alert boxes …and… . . You can include info boxes Images . . Code .
